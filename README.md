Input data description

Protein quantification data were obtained by SWATH-MS (Sequential Window Acquisition of all Theoretical Mass Spectra) using a TripleTOF® 6600 LC–MS/MS system (AB Sciex).
A spectral library was generated from pooled samples analyzed by DDA (Data-Dependent Acquisition) and processed with ProteinPilot.
SWATH-MS (DIA) runs and targeted ion extraction were performed in PeakView v2.2 with the SWATH Acquisition MicroApp v2.0, based on the DDA-derived library.
Integrated peak areas were processed in MarkerView v1.3.1 for relative quantification.
